# Research Agents Folder

This folder contains sub‑folders for each slide’s research agent. Each sub‑folder contains:
- `task.md`: description of research tasks.
- `outline.md` (if needed): reference to the outline template.

**Next steps**:
1. Start with `Slide1_Agent` to gather emerging trends.
2. Proceed sequentially or in parallel as resources allow.
